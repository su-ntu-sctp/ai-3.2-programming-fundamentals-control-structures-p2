- [Slide Deck](./slides.md)

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to

* **Apply decision-making and looping constructs** (if-else, switch, for, while) to control program execution and create dynamic, responsive Java applications.
* **Organize code using packages and methods** to build modular, maintainable applications following professional Java development practices.
* **Implement method overloading and access modifiers** to create flexible, reusable code while properly encapsulating functionality.
